The folder contains the main Blocks World Plus (BWP) test domain used in this thesis.

- The *single_puzzle* folder contains problem and domain definitions for the standard single puzzle versions of the BWP. These were the ones used in the thesis.
- The *multi_puzzle* folder contains large and more complex BWP problems where there are multiple puzzle rooms, each with the own table, and set of blocks to be stacked into towers. These were not included in the thesis due to time and spase constraints.
