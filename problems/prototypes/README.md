This folder contains two older prototype problem and domain definitions for the BWP that contain two heterogenous robots within them:
- drone_prototype.lp has talos the humanoid robot and jericho a drone that can pickup and move blocks,
- transport_robot_prototype.lp has talos and a robot that can transport blocks placed upon it.

Note that both of these use an outdated syntax and would need to be updated to be ran by ASH as it is now.
