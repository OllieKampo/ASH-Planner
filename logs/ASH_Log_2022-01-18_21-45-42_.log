%%%%    minimise_actions: bool - A Boolean, True to enable minimisation of the total quantity of actions in a plan, False to disable.

%%%%    preempt_pos_fgoals: bool - A Boolean, True to enable the search heuristic that prefers pre-mptively achieving positive final-goal literals, False to disable.
