This does not appear to cause much issue in terms of plan quality, as it does not require the planner to find a low quality plan.
It is however, not the desired behaviour, and shows that the guidance provided by the conformance constraint, in terms of how well the sub-goal stages guide planning at the original level through an optimal sequence or path of states.
On the other hand, it is good that the conformance constraint is sufficiently flexible to avoid this clearly non-optimal abstract plan from refining to a highly non-optimal original level plan, after all, the abstract planning is far from omniscient, and this may happen often.
It remains to be seen where the line between strictness and flexibility on the constraint stands, where do get the most retriction on the search space/time, with the least loss in plan quality in general.
This will require much more extensive testing of a larger number of domains and hierarchical conformance refinement planning problems.
