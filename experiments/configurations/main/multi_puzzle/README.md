These experiments test the scalability of the approach to problems with much longer minimal plan lengths.
Some of the best performing configurations are tested for the larger multiple puzzle versions of the small and large problems.
Their performance relative to the single puzzle variants indicates how well this approach can performing when planning with large repetative problems.
