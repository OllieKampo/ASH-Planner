# Problem Blending

Applicable only for online planning.
Tested for only a small number of divisions (combinations; 2=2 1=2, 2=2 1=4, 2=4 1=2, 2=4 1=4) on only the small problems.
Obviously for a very large number of divisions this will not be effectively, as it is unlikely to remove the dependencies whilst having a very large overhead on the planning time.
It also does not make much practical sense to blend over a large number of divisions, since if the desire is to reduce dependencies, then one would favour less divisions anyway.
