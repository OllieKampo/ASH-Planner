== Description ==

Initial experiments: Problem version 3.
Online hierarchical conformance refinement planning.
Basic problem division with bounds: level 3 = 2, level 2 = 4.
Sequential yield planning mode.
Final-goal pre-emptive achievement preferences enabled in heuristic mode.

Average ground plan length is ~  steps.
Average completion time is ~  seconds.
Average memory usage is ~  MBs.
