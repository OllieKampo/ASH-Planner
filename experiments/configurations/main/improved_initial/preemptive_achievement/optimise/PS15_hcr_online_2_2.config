== Description ==

Initial experiments: Problem version 1.5.
Online hierarchical conformance refinement planning.
Basic problem division with bounds: level 3 = 2, level 2 = 2.

Average ground plan length is ~  steps.
Average completion time is ~  seconds.
Average memory usage is ~  MBs.

Almost always causes the unconsidered final goal problem because at level 2 block 3 does not have to be moved.
Only avoids the unconsidered final goal problem iff the planner arbitrarily chooses to stack the entire tower whose base is block 6 first.
Otherwise, stacking the tower whose base is block 3 is involved in a non-final partial problem, and the planner starts stacking it on the wrong side of the table, and must undo this in the final partial problem.
