== Description ==

Improved initial experiments - Final-goal pre-emptive achievement: Small problem version 1.5.

Online hierarchical conformance refinement planning.
Basic problem division strategy.
Minimum search length bound enabled.
Final-goal pre-emptive achievement preferences enabled in optimise mode.

Classical optimal plan length is 3=15 2=23 1=39 steps.
True refinement optimum length is 3=  2=  1=  steps.

Almost always causes the unconsidered final goal problem because at level 2 block 3 does not have to be moved.
Only avoids the unconsidered final goal problem iff the planner arbitrarily chooses to stack the entire tower whose base is block 6 first.
Otherwise, stacking the tower whose base is block 3 is involved in a non-final partial problem, and the planner starts stacking it on the wrong side of the table, and must undo this in the final partial problem.
