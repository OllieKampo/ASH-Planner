# Improved Initial Experiments

Improved initial experiments test a sub-set of the initial experiments again for each of the proposed solutions to the fundamental problems of conformance refinement.

These are tested in the following order, with the best performing configurations carried forward to the next set of experiments.

- Final-Goal Pre-emptive Achievement: 
- Concurrent Action Planning:
- Problem Blending:
