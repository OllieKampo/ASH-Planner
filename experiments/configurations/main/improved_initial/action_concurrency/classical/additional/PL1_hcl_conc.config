== Description ==

Improved initial experiments - Concurrent action planning: Large problem version 1.

Hierarchical classical planning.
Concurrent action planning enabled.

Classical optimum length is 3=29 2=55 1=85 (estimated) steps.
Classical concurrent optimum is 3=(18,29) 2=(34,57) 3=(63,85).

With concurrent classical planning, the top-level becomes trivial to solve.
This is because the search time maintains a simialr trend with search length to sequential action planning, but the search length of the minimal plan is almost halved.
This is desite the small overhead in terms of grounding the additional rules that enforce the concurrency conditions.
The difference in grounding time between this and the sequential classical should tell us the complexity of grounding those rules.
