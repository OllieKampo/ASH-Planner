== Description ==

Improved initial experiments - Concurrent action planning: Problem version 2.
Offline hierarchical conformance refinement planning.
Standard planning mode.
Concurrent action planning enabled.

Classical optimal plan length is 3=18 2=34 1=53 steps.
True refinement optimum length is 2=  1=  steps.
Average refined plan quality is 2=  1= steps and 2=  1= actions.
Average absolution time is ~  seconds.
Average maximum memory usage is ~  MBs.
