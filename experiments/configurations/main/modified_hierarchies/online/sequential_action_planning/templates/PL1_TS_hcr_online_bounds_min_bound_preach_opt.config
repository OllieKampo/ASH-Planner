== Description ==

Modified hierarchy experiments: Large problem tasking version 1.

Online hierarchical conformance refinement planning.
Basic problem division strategy.
Minimum search length bound enabled.
Final-goal pre-emptive achievement preferences enabled in optimise mode.

Classical optimal plan length is 4= 3=29 2=55 1=85 steps.
True refinement optimum length is 3= 2= 1= steps.

Relaxed models start to become intractable after plans that are much longer than 20 steps, even in a refinement.
This experimental configuration adds an additional tasking model to the large problem with extra blocks.
This allows the relaxed model to be solved as a sequence of smaller partial refinement problems, which are far more managable than offline planning, with or without the tasking model.
