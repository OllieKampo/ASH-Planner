== Description ==

Initial experiments: Medium problem version 1.
Online hierarchical conformance refinement planning.
Basic problem division with bounds: level 4 = 4, level 3 = 2, level 2 = 2.
Minimum search length bound enabled.

True refinement optimum length is  steps.
Average completion time is  ~ seconds.
Average memory usage is  ~ MBs.

Relaxed models start to become intractable after plans that are much longer than 20 steps, even in a refinement.
This experimental configuration adds an additional tasking model to the medium problem with extra blocks.
This allows the relaxed model to be solved as a sequence of smaller partial refinement problems, which are far more managable than offline planning, with or without the tasking model.
