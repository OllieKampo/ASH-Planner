== Description ==

Modified hierarchy experiments: Large problem tasking double condensed version 3.

Hierarchical classical planning.
Ran with time limit of 10 hours in an attempt to obtain the classical optimum plan lengths.

Classical optimum plan length is 5=17 4=29 3=55 2=85 1=147 (estimated) steps.
Ground-level is unsolvable within time limit and available memory capacity of 16GBs.
Estimated ground-level minimal plan length is 147 steps based on;
    - Large problem 1 plan length is 85 steps,
        - Since the manipulation plan is the only thing that changes in this problem,
        - Additional manipulation plan length of small problem 3 is 18 = 85 - 67
    - Large problem 2 plan length is 129 steps,
    - Since large problem 3 is a combination of large problem 1 and 2,
    - The optimum length is 147 = 129 + 18
It is not possible even to check for a solution of this length,
as the solving time still exceeds the time limit.
