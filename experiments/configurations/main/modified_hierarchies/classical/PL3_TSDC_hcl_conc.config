== Description ==

Modified hierarchy experiments: Large problem tasking double condensed version 3.

Hierarchical classical planning.
Concurrent action planning enabled.
Ran with time limit of 10 hours in an attempt to obtain the classical optimum plan lengths.

Classical optimum plan length is 5=17 4=29 3=55 2=85 1=147 (estimated) steps.
Classical concurrent optimum is 5=(9,18) 4=(18,29) 3=(34,57) 2=(63,85) 1=Unknown.
