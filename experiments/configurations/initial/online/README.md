Online planning testing
-----------------------

Tested in: min-bound planning mode.
For problems: small[1-3].
Configurations: tested for bounds (level 3 = 2, level 2 = 2), (level 3 = 2, level 2 = 4), (level 3 = 4, level 2 = 2) and (level 3 = 4, level 2 = 4) for all problems.

What is clear, is that the best bound configuration differs depending on the problem.
In particular, the differing expansion factors across the various problems, warrant different bounds.
As a result, there is no silver bullet in terms of the best bounds available.
