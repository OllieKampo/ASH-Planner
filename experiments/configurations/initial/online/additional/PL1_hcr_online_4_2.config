== Description ==

Initial experiments: Large problem version 1.

Online hierarchical conformance refinement planning.
Basic problem division strategy.
Minimum search length bound enabled.

Classical optimal plan length is 3=29 2=55 1=85 steps.
True refinement optimum length is 3=  2=  1=  steps.

Top-level plan starts to become expensive to generate due to larger number of blocks that have to be moved.
Ignorance and dependency problems have similar impact (propoptionally) to the small problems.
However, the unconsidered goal problem now has huge impact on planning time, since the ground-level plans are much longer.
