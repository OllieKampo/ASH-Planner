== Description ==

Initial experiments: Large problem version 2.
Online hierarchical conformance refinement planning.
Basic problem division strategy.
Minimum search length bound enabled.

Classical optimal plan length is 3=20 2=42 1=118 steps.
True refinement optimum length is 3=  2=  1=  steps.
Average refined plan length is 2=  1=  steps.
Average absolution time is ~  seconds.
Average maximum memory usage is ~  MBs.

Bottom-level plan starts to become expensive to generate due to the large condensing factor of the condensed model caused by the greater number of cells per room.
This makes the ground-level expansion factor very large, i.e. the ground-plan length is longer but the number of constraint sub-goal stages is the same, which forms are weaker constraint.
This indicates that the expansion factor is critical to the speed of refinement planning, and needs to managed carefully.
