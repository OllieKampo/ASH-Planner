== Description ==

Initial experiments: Large problem version 1.
Online hierarchical conformance refinement planning.
Basic problem division with bounds: level 3 = 2, level 2 = 2.

Classical optimal plan length is 3=  2=  1=  steps.
True refinement optimum length is 2=  1=  steps.
Average refined plan length is 2=  1=  steps.
Average completion time is ~  seconds.
Average memory usage is ~  MBs.

Top-level plan starts to become expensive to generate.
Ignorance and dependency problems have similar impact (propoptionally) to the small problems.
However, the unconsidered goal problem now has huge impact on planning time, since the ground-level plans are much longer.
