== Description ==

Initial experiments: Large problem version 2.
Offline hierarchical conformance refinement planning.
Standard planning mode.

Classical optimal plan length is 3=  2=  1=  steps.
True refinement optimum length is 2=  1=  steps.
Average refined plan length is 2=  1=  steps.
Average completion time is ~  seconds.
Average memory usage is ~  MBs.
