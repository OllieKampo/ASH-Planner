== Description ==

Initial experiments: Problem version 1.
Offline hierarchical conformance refinement planning.
Sequential yield planning mode.

Classical optimal plan length is 3=18 2=26 1=39 steps.
True refinement optimum length is 39 steps.
Average plan length is 39 steps (reaches classical optimum in 100% of test runs).
Average absolution time is ~  seconds.
Average maximum memory usage is ~  MBs.

Grounding times appear to have clear linear increasing trend with search length.
Solving and total times have increasing trend but fluctuate significantly, and lose the clear exponential trend.
Grounding time contributes majority towards total time.
Sequential yield minimal achievement steps tend to have lower solving time, and much more consistent solving times (lower standard deviation than other steps).
