== Description ==

Initial experiments: Large problem version 2.

Hierarchical classical planning.
Ran with time limit of 10 hours in an attempt to obtain the classical optimum plan lengths.

Classical optimum length is 3=20 2=42 1=Unknown steps.
Ground-level is unsolvable within time limit and available memory capacity of 16GBs.
Estimated ground-level minimal plan length is 118 steps based on;
    - Large problem locomotive plan length should be 85 steps,
    - Small problem locomotive plan length is 34 steps,
    - Since the locomotive plan is the only thing that changes in this problem,
    - The optimum length is 118 = 67 + (85 - 34)
It is not possible even to check for a solution of this length,
as the solving time still exceeds the time limit.
