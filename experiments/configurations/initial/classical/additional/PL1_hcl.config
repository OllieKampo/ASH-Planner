== Description ==

Initial experiments: Large problem version 1.

Hierarchical classical planning.
Ran with time limit of 10 hours in an attempt to obtain the classical optimum plan lengths.

Classical optimum length is 3=29 2=55 1=85 steps.
Average total time is 3=152 2=2874 1=19307 seconds.
Average memory usage is 3=360 2=860 1=2300 MBs.
